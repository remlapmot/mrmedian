          Description

              mrleaveoneout performs leave one out analysis, in which each genotype is omitted in turn from
              the analysis.  A plot of the estimates is shown by default.

              For multiple exposure models such as MVMR and MVMR-Egger the estimate is collected for the
              first phenotype.

              varname_gd is a variable containing the genotype-disease association estimates.

              varname_gp is a variable containing the genotype-phenotype association estimates.

          Options

              method(string) Specifies the method used for the analysis.  Must be one of ivw, egger,
                  mregger, mrivw, median, mrmedian, mrmodal, modal, mode, mvmr, mvivw, mvegger.

          Examples

              Using the data provided by Do et al. (2013).

              Setup
                  . use https://raw.github.com/remlapmot/mrrobust/master/dodata, clear

              Select observations (p-value with exposure < 10^-8)
                  . gen byte sel2 = (ldlcp2 < 1e-25)

              Perform leave one out analysis using the IVW estimator
                  . mrleaveoneout chdbeta ldlcbeta if sel2==1, gyse(chdse) genotype(rsid)

              Leave one out analysis using MVMR (collecting the estimate for LDL-c)
                  . mrleaveoneout chdbeta ldlcbeta hdlcbeta tgbeta if sel2==1, method(mvmr) gyse(chdse)
                      genotype(rsid)
